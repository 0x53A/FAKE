### Description

Please give a brief explanation about your change.

Potentially link to an existing issue this PR fixes. For example:

- fixes #1234

## TODO

- [] New (API-)documentation for new features exist (Note: API-docs are enough, additional docs are in `help/markdown`)
- [] (if bugfix) unit or integration test exists (or short reasoning why it doesn't make sense)
- [] (if new module) the module has been linked from the "Modules" menu, edit `help/templates/template.cshtml`, linking to the API-reference is fine.
- [] (if new module) the module is in the correct namespace
- [] Fake 5 [API guideline](https://fake.build/contributing.html#API-Design) is honored
