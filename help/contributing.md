Contributing to FAKE
=======================

This page should provide you with some basic information if you're thinking about contributing to FAKE.

 * This page can be edited by sending a pull request to the FAKE project on GitHub, so if you learn something when playing with FAKE please record your [findings here](https://github.com/fsharp/FAKE/blob/master/help/contributing.md)!

 * If you want to discuss a feature (a good idea!), or if you want to look at suggestions how you might contribute, check out the [Issue list](https://github.com/fsharp/FAKE/issues) on GitHub or send an email to the [FAKE mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/fsharpMake).

## Documentation

The documentation for FAKE is automatically generated using the amazing [F# Formatting](https://github.com/tpetricek/FSharp.Formatting) library.
It turns `*.md` (Markdown with embedded code snippets) and `*.fsx` files (F# script file with embedded Markdown documentation) into a nice HTML documentation.

 * The code for all the documents can be found in the `help` directory [on GitHub](https://github.com/fsharp/FAKE/tree/master/help). If you find a bug or add a new feature, make sure you document it!

 * If you want to build the documentation, simply run the build script [GitHub link](https://github.com/fsharp/FAKE/blob/master/build.fsx)) which builds the documentation.
